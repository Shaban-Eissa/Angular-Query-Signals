# Building TanStack Query

This project is a custom implementation of TanStack Query concepts in Angular 19, powered by Signals. It demonstrates how modern Angular's reactivity model can be used to handle server state management declaratively, without external libraries.

## How Query State is Implemented

This project demonstrates a custom implementation of query state management using Angular signals. The `query-state.service.ts` provides:

- Custom query hooks with Angular signals
- Configurable caching with staleTime
- Loading and error states
- Local storage persistence for cached data
- Data invalidation and manual refetching
